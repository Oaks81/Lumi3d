description: Implement the current feature with TDD approach
---

Implement the planned feature for: $ARGUMENTS

Process:
1. Write tests first (in __tests__/ directory)
2. Run tests to confirm they fail
3. Implement the feature incrementally
4. Run tests after each change
5. Keep iterating until all tests pass
6. Update CLAUDE.md if new patterns emerge

Use these standards:
- Pure JavaScript (ES6+)
- Modular design
- Performance-conscious (this is rendering code)
