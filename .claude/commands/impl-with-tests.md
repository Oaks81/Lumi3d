description: Implement feature with tests first (TDD)
---

Implement: $ARGUMENTS

Process:
1. Read docs/features/$ARGUMENTS.md
2. Create test file first based on "Test Criteria" section
3. Implement feature to pass tests
4. Run tests and iterate until passing
5. Log "Feature $ARGUMENTS complete" when done

Use test criteria from spec markdown. Run the application with Puppeteer and confirm that visuals match what is expected.
